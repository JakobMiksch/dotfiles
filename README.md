# Dotfiles

Used on Debian 10 and Linux Mint and `zsh` as standard shell. But of course usable in other environments as well.

## Issues

- [ ] vim directories `swap`, `undo` and `backup` need to be created
- [ ] NVM check if it the entry in `.zshrc` does not throw an error if `nvm` is not installed

## Extra Software to Install

[Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm);

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```
