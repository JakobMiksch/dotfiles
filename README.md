Used on Debian 10 and Linux Mint and `zsh` as standard shell. But of course usable in other environments as well.

## Issues

- [ ] Vim solarized theme not found
- [ ] vim directories `swap`, `undo` and `backup` need to be created
- [ ] NVM check if it the entry in `.zshrc` does not throw an error if `nvm` is not installed
